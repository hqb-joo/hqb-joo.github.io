- We fine-tuned several popular CNNs (Alexnet, VGG, ResNet) according to the regularities which are tailored for determining mutual overlapping image pairs for SfM. 
- A new training dataset consisting of regular photogrammetric images and crowdsourced images from the Internet was generated by fully considering photogrammetric requirements and 3D mesh models.
- Learnable multiple NetVLADs for each regional information were employed to further improve the retrieval performance.

- KNN-VA model: The Euclidean distance was used as the measurement standard, and the KNN algorithm was used to select the K samples closest to the test sample. The average value was taken as the prediction speed. 
- KNN-RBF model: On the basis of KNN-VA, the standardized training samples were input into the trained RBF Network to predict the velocity.
- Boosting algorithm was used to fuse A and B to improve prediction performance.
